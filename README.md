InformationPrivacyProject
=========================

A project that attempts to find a way to obfuscate the data collected by insurance companies that use in 
car meters so they can't glean where the driver went, without ruining the usefulness of the data for the
insurance company.

Currently, insurance companies can guess with fairly good certanty where a driver went knowing just where they live
and the information collected (velocity, time, and time of day) from the meters they install. However, some
drivers may find this a breach of their privacy.
